      <h1>Memory Representation of Values</h1>

      <p>
	The FFI interface we described
	in <a href="19-foreign-function-interface.html#foreign-function-interface" data-type="xref">Chapter 19, Foreign Function Interface</a> hides the
	precise details of how values are exchanged across C libraries
	and the OCaml runtime. There is a simple reason for this:
	using this interface directly is a delicate operation that
	requires understanding a few different moving parts before you
	can get it right. You first need to know the mapping between
	OCaml types and their runtime memory representation. You also
	need to ensure that your code is interfacing correctly with
	OCaml runtime's memory management.

	<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="values" data-secondary="memory representation of" id="VALmemory">&nbsp;</a></p>

      <p>
	However, knowledge of the OCaml internals is useful beyond
	just writing foreign function interfaces. As you build and
	maintain more complex OCaml applications, you'll need to
	interface with various external system tools that operate on
	compiled OCaml binaries. For example, profiling tools report
	output based on the runtime memory layout, and debuggers
	execute binaries without any knowledge of the static OCaml
	types. To use these tools effectively, you'll need to do some
	translation between the OCaml and C worlds. 

	<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="interfaces" data-secondary="with OCaml binaries">&nbsp;</a></p>

      <p>
	Luckily, the OCaml toolchain is very predictable. The
	compiler minimizes the amount of optimization magic that it
	performs, and relies instead on its straightforward execution
	model for good performance. With some experience, you can know
	rather precisely where a block of performance-critical OCaml
	code is spending its time.

      <div data-type="note">
	<h1>Why Do OCaml Types Disappear at Runtime?</h1>

	<p>
	  The OCaml compiler runs through several phases during the
	  compilation process. The first phase is syntax checking,
	  during which source files are parsed into abstract syntax
	  trees (ASTs). The next stage is a <em>type checking</em> pass
	  over the AST. In a validly typed program, a function cannot
	  be applied with an unexpected type. For example, the
	  <code>print_endline</code> function must receive a single
	  <code>string</code> argument, and an <code>int</code> will
	  result in a type error.

	  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="compilation process" data-secondary="phases of">&nbsp;</a></p>

	<p>
	  Since OCaml verifies these properties at compile time, it
	  doesn't need to keep track of as much information at runtime.
	  Thus, later stages of the compiler can discard and simplify
	  the type declarations to a much more minimal subset that's
	  actually required to distinguish polymorphic values at
	  runtime. This is a major performance win versus something
	  like a Java or .NET method call, where the runtime must look
	  up the concrete instance of the object and dispatch the
	  method call. Those languages amortize some of the cost via
	  "Just-in-Time" dynamic patching, but OCaml prefers runtime
	  simplicity instead.

	<h1>OCaml Blocks and Values</h1>

	<p>
	  A running OCaml program uses blocks of memory (i.e.,
	  contiguous sequences of words in RAM) to represent values
	  such as tuples, records, closures, or arrays. An OCaml
	  program implicitly allocates a block of memory when such a
	  value is created:

</pre></div> 

	<p>
	  The type declaration <code>t</code> doesn't take up any
	  memory at runtime, but the subsequent <code>let</code>
	  binding allocates a new block of memory with two words of
	  available space. One word holds the <code>foo</code> field,
	  and the other word holds the <code>bar</code> field. The
	  OCaml compiler translates such an expression into an explicit
	  allocation for the block from OCaml's runtime system.</p>

	<p>
	  OCaml uses a uniform memory representation in which every
	  OCaml variable is stored as a <em>value</em>. An OCaml value
	  is a single memory word that is either an immediate integer
	  or a pointer to some other memory. The OCaml runtime tracks
	  all values so that it can free them when they are no longer
	  needed. It thus needs to be able to distinguish between
	  integer and pointer values, since it scans pointers to find
	  further values but doesn't follow integers that don't point
	  to anything meaningful beyond their immediate value.

          <h2>Distinguishing Integers and Pointers at Runtime</h2>

          <p>
	    Wrapping primitives types (such as integers) inside
            another data structure that records extra metadata about
            the value is known as <em>boxing</em>. Values are boxed in
            order to make it easier for the garbage collector (GC) to
            do its job, but at the expense of an extra level of
            indirection to access the data within the boxed value.
            
	    <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="garbage collection" data-secondary="and boxed values">&nbsp;</a>
	    <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="boxing (of values)">&nbsp;</a>
	    <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="values" data-secondary="boxing of">&nbsp;</a></p>

          <p>
	    OCaml values don't all have to be boxed at runtime.
            Instead, values use a single tag bit per word to
            distinguish integers and pointers at runtime. The value is
            an integer if the lowest bit of the block word is nonzero,
            and a pointer if the lowest bit of the block word is zero.
            Several OCaml types map onto this integer representation,
            including <code>bool</code>, <code>int</code>, the empty
            list, <code>unit</code>, and variants without
            constructors.</p>

          <p>
	    This representation means that integers are unboxed
            runtime values in OCaml so that they can be stored directly
            without having to allocate a wrapper block. They can be
            passed directly to other function calls in registers and
            are generally the cheapest and fastest values to use in
            OCaml.</p>

          <p>
	    A value is treated as a memory pointer if its lowest bit
            is zero. A pointer value can still be stored unmodified
            despite this, since pointers are guaranteed to be
            word-aligned (with the bottom bits always being zero).</p>

          <p>
	    The only problem that remains with this memory
            representation is distinguishing between pointers to OCaml
            values (which should be followed by the GC) and pointers
            into the system heap to C values (which shouldn't be
            followed).</p>

          <p>
	    The mechanism for this is simple, since the runtime
            system keeps track of the heap blocks it has allocated for
            OCaml values. If the pointer is inside a heap chunk that is
            marked as being managed by the OCaml runtime, it is assumed
            to point to an OCaml value. If it points outside the OCaml
            runtime area, it is treated as an opaque C pointer to some
            other system resource.

            <h1>Some History About OCaml's Word-Aligned Pointers</h1>

            <p>
	      The alert reader may be wondering how OCaml can
              guarantee that all of its pointers are word-aligned. In
              the old days, when RISC chips such as Sparc, MIPS, and
              Alpha were commonplace, unaligned memory accesses were
              forbidden by the instruction set architecture and would
              result in a CPU exception that terminated the program.
              Thus, all pointers were historically rounded off to the
              architecture word size (usually 32 or 64 bits).
              
	      <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="unaligned memory access">&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>
	      Modern CISC processors such as the Intel x86 do
              support unaligned memory accesses, but the chip still
              runs faster if accesses are word-aligned. OCaml therefore
              simply mandates that all pointers be word-aligned, which
              guarantees that the bottom few bits of any valid pointer
              will be zero. Setting the bottom bit to a nonzero value
              is a simple way to mark an integer, at the cost of losing
              that single bit of precision.</p>

            <p>
	      An even more alert reader will be wondering about the
              performance implications are for integer arithmetic using
              this tagged representation. Since the bottom bit is set,
              any operation on the integer has to shift the bottom bit
              right to recover the "native" value. The native code
              OCaml compiler generates efficient x86 assembly code in
              this case, taking advantage of modern processor
              instructions to hide the extra shifts where possible.
              Addition is a single <code>LEA</code> x86 instruction,
              subtraction can be two instructions, and multiplication
              is only a few more.</p>

	<h1>Blocks and Values</h1>

	<p>
	  An OCaml <em>block</em> is the basic unit of allocation on
	  the heap. A block consists of a one-word header (either 32 or
	  64 bits depending on the CPU architecture) followed by
	  variable-length data that is either opaque bytes or an array
	  of <em>fields</em>. The header has a multipurpose tag byte
	  that defines whether to interpret the subsequent data as
	  opaque bytes or OCaml fields. 

	  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="runtime memory representation" data-secondary="blocks and values">&nbsp;</a></p>

	<p>
	  The GC never inspects opaque bytes. If the tag indicates
	  an array of OCaml fields are present, their contents are all
	  treated as more valid OCaml values. The GC always inspects
	  fields and follows them as part of the collection process
	  described earlier.

	<figure style="float: 0">
          <img src="images/memory-repr/block.png"/>
	</figure>

	<p>
	  The <code>size</code> field records the length of the
	  block in memory words. This is 22 bits on 32-bit platforms,
	  which is the reason OCaml strings are limited to 16 MB on
	  that architecture. If you need bigger strings, either switch
	  to a 64-bit host, or use the <code>Bigarray</code>
	  module.</p>

	<p>
	  The 2-bit <code>color</code> field is used by the GC to
	  keep track of its state during mark-and-sweep collection.
	  We'll come back to this field in <a href="21-garbage-collector.html#understanding-the-garbage-collector" data-type="xref">Chapter 21, Understanding The Garbage Collector</a>.
	  This tag isn't exposed to OCaml source code in any case.</p>

	<p>
	  A block's tag byte is multipurpose, and indicates whether
	  the data array represents opaque bytes or fields. If a
	  block's tag is greater than or equal to
	  <code>No_scan_tag</code> (251), then the block's data are all
	  opaque bytes, and are not scanned by the collector. The most
	  common such block is the <code>string</code> type, which we
	  describe in more detail later in this chapter.</p>

	<p>
	  The exact representation of values inside a block depends on
	  their static OCaml type. All OCaml types are distilled down
	  into <code>values</code>, and summarized
	  in <a href="20-runtime-memory-layout.html#table20-1_ocaml" data-type="xref">Table20

          <h2>Integers, Characters, and Other Basic Types</h2>

          <p>
	    Many basic types are efficiently stored as unboxed
            integers at runtime. The native <code>int</code> type is
            the most obvious, although it drops a single bit of
            precision due to the tag bit. Other atomic types such as
            <code>unit</code> and the empty list <code>[]</code> value
            are stored as constant integers. Boolean values have a
            value of <code>1</code> and <code>0</code> for
            <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, respectively.

          <p>
	    These basic types such as empty lists and
            <code>unit</code> are very efficient to use, since integers
            are never allocated on the heap. They can be passed
            directly in registers and not appear on the stack if you
            don't have too many parameters to your functions. Modern
            architectures such as <code>x86_64</code> have a lot of
            spare registers to further improve the efficiency of using
            unboxed integers.</p>

	  The <code>Obj.repr</code> function retrieves the runtime

          <h2>Floating-Point Numbers and Arrays</h2>

          <p>
	    Floating-point numbers in OCaml are always stored as
            full, double-precision values. Individual floating-point
            values are stored as a block with a single field that
            contains the number. This block has the
            <code>Double_tag</code> set, which signals to the collector
            that the floating-point value is not to be scanned:

          <p>
	    Since each floating-point value is boxed in a separate
            memory block, it can be inefficient to handle large arrays
            of floats in comparison to unboxed integers. OCaml
            therefore special-cases records or arrays that contain
            <em>only</em> <code>float</code> types. These are stored in
            a block that contains the floats packed directly in the
            data section, with <code>Double_array_tag</code> set to
            signal to the collector that the contents are not OCaml
            values.</p>

          <figure style="float: 0">

          </figure>

          <p>
	    First, let's check that float arrays do in fact have a
            different tag number from normal floating-point values:</p>

          <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">#</span> <span class="nn">Obj</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">double_tag</span> <span class="o">;;</span>

</pre></div> 

          <p>
	    This tells us that float arrays have a tag value of 254.
            Now let's test some sample values using the
            <code>Obj.tag</code> function to check that the allocated
            block has the expected runtime tag, and also use
            <code>Obj.double_field</code> to retrieve a float from
            within the block:</p>

          <p>
	    The first thing we tested was that a float array has the
            correct unboxed float array tag value (254). However, the
            next line tests a tuple of floating-point values instead,
            which are <em>not</em> optimized in the same way and have
            the normal tuple tag value (0).</p>

          <p>
	    Only records and arrays can have the float array
            optimization, and for records, every single field must be a
            float.</p>

	  a tag of <code>1</code>, as the use of <code>Obj.tag</code>

          <h1>Obj Module Considered Harmful</h1>

          <p>
	    <code>Obj</code> is an undocumented module that exposes
            the internals of the OCaml compiler and runtime. It is very
            useful for examining and understanding how your code will
            behave at runtime but should <em>never</em> be used for
            production code unless you understand the implications. The
            module bypasses the OCaml type system, making memory
            corruption and segmentation faults possible.</p>

          <p>
	    Some theorem provers such as Coq do output code that
            uses <code>Obj</code> internally, but the external module
            signatures never expose it. Unless you too have a machine
            proof of correctness to accompany your use of
            <code>Obj</code>, stay away from it except for
            debugging!</p>
	</div>

	<p>
	  Due to this encoding, there is a limit around 240 variants
	  with parameters that applies to each type definition, but the
	  only limit on the number of variants without parameters is
	  the size of the native integer (either 31 or 63 bits). This
	  limit arises because of the size of the tag byte, and that
	  some of the high-numbered tags are reserved.</p>

      <section id="polymorphic-variants-1" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>Polymorphic Variants</h1>

	<p>
	  Polymorphic variants are more flexible than normal
	  variants when writing code but are slightly less efficient at
	  runtime. This is because there isn't as much static
	  compile-time information available to optimize their memory
	  layout.

	  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="polymorphic variant types" data-secondary="memory representation of">&nbsp;</a>

	<p>
	  A polymorphic variant without any parameters is stored as
	  an unboxed integer and so only takes up one word of memory,
	  just like a normal variant. This integer value is determined
	  by applying a hash function to the <em>name</em> of the
	  variant. The hash function isn't exposed directly by the
	  compiler, but the <code>type_conv</code> library from Core
	  provides an alternative implementation:</p>

</pre></div> 

	<p>
	  The hash function is designed to give the same results on
	  32-bit and 64-bit architectures, so the memory representation
	  is stable across different CPUs and host types.</p>

	<p>
	  Polymorphic variants use more memory space than normal
	  variants when parameters are included in the data type
	  constructors. Normal variants use the tag byte to encode the
	  variant value and save the fields for the contents, but this
	  single byte is insufficient to encode the hashed value for
	  polymorphic variants. They must allocate a new block (with
	  tag <code>0</code>) and store the value in there instead.
	  Polymorphic variants with constructors thus use one word of
	  memory more than normal variant constructors.</p>

	<p>
	  Another inefficiency over normal variants is when a
	  polymorphic variant constructor has more than one parameter.
	  Normal variants hold parameters as a single flat block with
	  multiple fields for each entry, but polymorphic variants must
	  adopt a more flexible uniform memory representation, since
	  they may be reused in a different context across compilation
	  units. They allocate a tuple block for the parameters that is
	  pointed to from the argument field of the variant. There are
	  thus three additional words for such variants, along with an
	  extra memory indirection due to the tuple.</p>

	<p>
	  The extra space usage is generally not significant in a
	  typical application, and polymorphic variants offer a great
	  deal more flexibility than normal variants. However, if
	  you're writing code that demands high performance or must run
	  within tight memory bounds, the runtime layout is at least
	  very predictable. The OCaml compiler never switches memory
	  representation due to optimization passes. This lets you
	  predict the precise runtime layout by referring to these
	  guidelines and your source code.</p>

      <section id="string-values" data-type="sect1">
	<h1>String Values</h1>

	<p>
	  Strings are standard OCaml blocks with the header size
	  defining the size of the string in machine words. The
	  <code>String_tag</code> (252) is higher than the
	  <code>No_scan_tag</code>, indicating that the contents of the
	  block are opaque to the collector. The block contents are the
	  contents of the string, with padding bytes to align the block
	  on a word boundary.

	<p>
	  On a 32-bit machine, the padding is calculated based on

	  This string representation is a clever way to ensure that
	  the contents are always zero-terminated by the padding word
	  and to still compute its length efficiently without scanning
	  the whole string. The following formula is used:</p>

	<figure style="float: 0">
          <img src="images/memory-repr/string_size_calc.png"/>
	</figure>

	<p>
	  The guaranteed <code>NULL</code> termination comes in
	  handy when passing a string to C, but is not relied upon to
	  compute the length from OCaml code. OCaml strings can thus
	  contain <code>NULL</code> bytes at any point within the
	  string.</p>

	<p>
	  Care should be taken that any C library functions that
	  receive these buffers can also cope with arbitrary bytes
	  within the buffer contents and are not expecting C strings.
	  For instance, the C <code>memcopy</code> or
	  <code>memmove</code> standard library functions can operate
	  on arbitrary data, but <code>strlen</code> or
	  <code>strcpy</code> both require a
	  <code>NULL</code>-terminated buffer, and neither has a
	  mechanism for encoding a <code>NULL</code> value within its
	  contents.</p>

	<h1>Custom Heap Blocks</h1>

	<p>
	  OCaml supports <em>custom</em> heap blocks via a
	  <code>Custom_tag</code> that lets the runtime perform
	  user-defined operations over OCaml values. A custom block
	  lives in the OCaml heap like an ordinary block and can be of
	  whatever size the user desires. The <code>Custom_tag</code>
	  (255) is higher than <code>No_scan_tag</code> and so isn't
	  scanned by the GC.

	  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="custom heap blocks">&nbsp;</a> 
	  <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="runtime memory representation" data-secondary="custom heap blocks">&nbsp;</a></p>

	<p>
	  The first word of the data within the custom block is a C
	  pointer to a <code>struct</code> of custom operations. The
	  custom block cannot have pointers to OCaml blocks and is
	  opaque to the GC:</p>

	<div class="highlight"><pre>struct custom_operations {
  char *identifier;
  void (*finalize)(value v);
  int (*compare)(value v1, value v2);
  intnat (*hash)(value v);
  void (*serialize)(value v,
                    /*out*/ uintnat * wsize_32 /*size in bytes*/,
                    /*out*/ uintnat * wsize_64 /*size in bytes*/);
  uintnat (*deserialize)(void * dst);
  int (*compare_ext)(value v1, value v2);
};
</pre></div> 

	<p>
	  The custom operations specify how the runtime should perform
	  polymorphic comparison, hashing and binary marshaling. They
	  also optionally contain a <em>finalizer</em> that the
	  runtime calls just before the block is
	  garbage-collected. This finalizer has nothing to do with
	  ordinary OCaml finalizers (as created
	  by <code>Gc.finalize</code> and explained
	  in <a href="21-garbage-collector.html#understanding-the-garbage-collector" data-type="xref">Chapter 21, Understanding The Garbage Collector</a>).
	  They are instead used to call C cleanup functions such
	  as <code>free</code>.

          <h2>Managing External Memory with Bigarray</h2>

          <p>
	    A common use of custom blocks is to manage external
            system memory directly from within OCaml. The Bigarray
            interface was originally intended to exchange data with
            Fortran code, and maps a block of system memory as a
            multidimensional array that can be accessed from OCaml.
            Bigarray operations work directly on the external memory
            without requiring it to be copied into the OCaml heap
            (which is a potentially expensive operation for large
            arrays).

          <p>
	    Bigarray sees a lot of use beyond just scientific
            computing, and several Core libraries use it for
            general-purpose I/O:</p>

          <dl>
            <dt><code>Iobuf</code></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>
		The <code>Iobuf</code> module maps I/O buffers as a
		one-dimensional array of bytes. It provides a sliding
		window interface that lets consumer processes read from
		the buffer while it's being filled by producers. This
		lets OCaml use I/O buffers that have been externally
		allocated by the operating system without any extra
		data copying.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt><code>Bigstring</code></dt>

            <dd>
              <p>
		The <code>Bigstring</code> module provides a
		<code>String</code>-like interface that uses
		<code>Bigarray</code> internally. The
		<code>Bigbuffer</code> collects these into extensible
		string buffers that can operate entirely on external
		system memory.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
	    The <a href="https://bitbucket.org/mmottl/lacaml">OCaml</a> library
            isn't part of Core but provides the recommended interfaces
            to the widely used BLAS and LAPACK mathematical Fortran
            libraries. These allow developers to write high-performance
            numerical code for applications that require linear
            algebra. It supports large vectors and matrices, but with
            static typing safety of OCaml to make it easier to write
            safe algorithms.
